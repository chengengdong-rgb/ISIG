# ISIG
Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) therapy benefits only a subset of cancer patients due to the tumor microenvironment’s immunosuppressive features. We integrated CRISPR/Cas9 screening and receptor-ligand data to develop an Immunosuppressive Interacting Gene (ISIG) signature that distinguishes responders from non-responders, correlating with PD-1/PD-L1/CTLA-4 expression. Single-cell RNA-seq analysis identified 13 outcome-linked immune subpopulations: responder-depleted CD4⁺ clusters (CD4_C2_HAVCR2/CD4_C6_LAG3/CD4_C7_CD300A) show exhaustion, while responder-enriched CD8⁺ clusters (CD8_C5_TNFRSF4/CD8_C6_CXCL13) exhibit cytotoxic/pro-inflammatory potential. The IMM_ISIG predicts ICI response with AUC=0.80, outperforming existing biomarkers. ITGA3/ITGB3 were identified as candidate targets linked to M2 macrophage infiltration and poor prognosis. Our work defines functional immune subsets governing ICI response, providing a clinically actionable framework for patient stratification and therapeutic targeting.
